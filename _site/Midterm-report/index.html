Together with the requirement to write a mid term report to the “Friends of Waldorf Education”, it also made me realize how quickly time has passed and how limited my remaining time in Canada is...<br />
Here is my midterm report for you to read:</p>

<p><strong>Midterm report by Finn Hansch</strong><br />
<strong><em>February 14, 2015</em></strong></p>

<p><em>The “Morning Glory School” is a small little private school with about 30 students. As a Waldorf oriented School with a limited budget we try to give the students the experiences of a Waldorf education.</em></p>

<p><em>As a former Waldorf student I am now working as a Waldorf teacher. I’m teaching German and Games (Sports) and help in the preschool as well as in the Kindergarden. My working hours are from 8:30am until 3:00pm.<br />
In the morning I help either in the Preschool or in the Kindergarden by preparing snack or supervising the kids, giving the teachers a break.<br />
Afterwards I alternate with teaching German and Games in the three Grades (Grades 1-2, 3-5, &amp; 6-8). From the very beginning I have been on my own while teaching. The first two months as a teacher I had to learn to keep the class under control and how to build up some authority. Nevertheless, due to my age and my special role I could keep a different relationship with the students. That helped me a lot to motivate the students and convey the fun of learning to them.<br />
Like other teachers will probably experience too, I still have to face the continual struggle of encouraging silence and concentration in class. But after the first half of the year I don’t feel that overwhelmed by it anymore.<br />
Something that I still struggle with is preparing for the german lessons. To unite the different age groups and the different language skills is not easy. On top of that there are a lot of new students who have never taken german lessons in school before. To help those students on their first steps while keeping it interesting for the others has been a constant challenge and I am sure it will stay like that for the months to come.<br />
These experiences have shown me how difficult it is to learn or teach a foreign language. At the same time it has woken a passion in me to learn more languages (I hope that I am also passing that enthusiasm to my students…).</em></p>

<p><em>Since we have chosen my successor for the next school year already I will also look into preparing the next years volunteer and hopefully give her a good start in the next school year (a help I have missed in my first steps of this experience).</em></p>

<p><em>As the only volunteer at the school, I have the great possibility to expand my english and to connect more with my surroundings. Despite the  cultural differences being small there are differences and I am getting to know a different world. On the other hand I can also give something special back to this culture myself.</em></p>

<p><em>I expect the second half of my voluntary service to be less demanding because I have gotten used to my occupation and it isn’t taking up all my time and energy anymore. Therefore I want to spend the time ahead of me, here in Canada, focusing more on my personal goals. For though I will still gain new experiences working at the school, I can now again approach some hobbies and projects of my own.</em></p>
