		<article class="content-entry"><p>Finally I managed to publish this post! A big THANK YOU to those of you patiently waiting.
My voyage here was a little adventure. It all started at Hamburg airport from where I was taking the flight to Munich and from there to Toronto!<br />
It took nine hours to get to Toronto and it was a smooth flight! However with my arrival in Toronto trouble startet!</p>

<p>Because I had to get my luggage from the baggage claim and check it in again I had to leave the security area! In order to do that I had to get to the immigration office to get my Visa printed into my passport!<br />
It took me 2 hours to wait in the line and in that time not only my connecting flight but also the next flight to Victoria had already departed. This left me with two choices. Either to wait until next morning and take the first flight to Victoria or to go on standby for a flight to Vancouver and fly over from there the next morning!<br />
I chose to stay in Toronto for the night and finally managed to inform someone that I wouldn’t show up in Victoria until morning.<br />
But the Adventure didn’t end yet! Arriving in Victoria I had to get to Nanaimo by bus because everyone was working and not able to pick me up! So I hitchhiked from the Airport into town to take the bus. There I had to trick the ticket seller by slightly lifting up my luggage to make it look like it weights 2 pounds less on the scale than it did.
In Nanaimo I had to wait a little more and then I finally - after a sleepless 48 hours trip - met my “new family” Mickey and her lovely son Eli (six years old) and got taken into my new home!<br />
The funny thing about my trip is that I tricked the jet lag  by not sleeping at all…  <br />
The next day I was invited to the first staff meeting of the school in which I’ll be teaching the next year and I met the other teachers!<br />
The rest of the time I was busy getting comfortable in my new surrounding! Being here is overwhelming! I’ve seen deer just walking beside the car and blocking the road. The landscape is fantastic and we are living at the end of the nice and not too small town, Qualicum Beach.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be my first day at work! I’m excited to see how it will go!</p>

<p>I’ll try to report back soon with new updates, so stay tuned until then!</p>
