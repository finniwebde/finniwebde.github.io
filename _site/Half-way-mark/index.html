		<article class="content-entry"><p>Hello everybody!
We have completed the second week of the second term. Not much has happened since I wrote last. I realized I have never actually told you much about my work! So before I start apologizing again I’ll just give you a quick catch up…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I am working from 8:30am until 3 o’clock in the afternoon! Except for Fridays when we end at half past 12.<br />
Every day I usually help in either the Preschool or the Kindergarten and teach all of the other grades in German or Games. So I am pretty much everywhere every day and obviously right in the middle of most of what is happening. That is not very difficult anyways because the school has only about 30 students in total!</p>

<p>On Monday and Wednesday mornings I help out in the Preschool. I prepare snack and do whatever there is to do! After a couple of weeks the Preschool teacher and I have become a pretty good team and things usually work quite smoothly. (Not to mention that there are only four children ages 3 to 4 in the class).<br />
After the kids “graduate” from Preschool they go to Kindergarten. Because they are close in age the Preschool and Kindergarten classes often join together for field trips or on Fridays.</p>

<p>On Tuesday’s and Thursday’s after the daily morning walk (with the older kids), I start out helping with math in Grades 3-5.* Since last week the class has been split in half for math only so that I teach the younger ones (currently devision) while the older kids learn advanced math with the class teacher.<br />
We are planning on replacing the morning walks on those 2 days with a morning run (led by me) because most of the kids are very active throughout the day and will probably benefit from burning more energy in the morning.<br />
Then I join the Kindergarten and eat snack with the kids before we go outside to play. That gives the Kindergarten teacher a little break on at least two of the weekdays.<br />
It is of course easier said than done. Before snack we have to tidy up the room and get everybody to help (usually the biggest hassle).<br />
Afterwards we have a little nap and then go to wash our hands for snack. Snacktime works out very well most of the time although the kids need constant reminding to stay at the table and eat their food.<br />
Towards the end of snack we all make little nests with our hands for “Poppy Bird”, (hopefully spelled right… but then again it doesn’t really matter does it?) a little felted purple bird tied to a string. I then fly Poppy Bird around the table to sit in everybody’s nest and the bird gives one child a kiss. The kissed child is then allowed to snuff out the candle accompanied by a little song sung by everybody. That of course is often connected with unfulfilled expectations and little jealousies because Poppy Bird can only kiss one child per day.</p>

<p>Then comes the logistical challenge of getting the table gnomes to clear and clean the table, the water washers to wash the dishes and the sweeping sprites to sweep, preferably at the same time and without me heaving to chase any of them.<br />
When everybody is done their tasks we head outside for some outdoor play time!</p>

<p>I really enjoy being with the “little” kids. Though they seem to often have problems with sharing or taking turns, most of the time they play very well together, which has improved as more children have joined the class.<br />
They all seem to like me well and they are still at the age where they show their feelings openly! It is a great experience and often brightens my day when I enter the room and most of them interrupt their play to greet me with a hug or to let everybody know “FINN IS HERE”!</p>

<p>Those are my mornings.
In the afternoon I alternate between Games and German with all the other classes. But I’ll leave that for another day.</p>

<p>One more thing I wanted to mention though.
Before Christmas we did a beautiful Advent Spiral. I had almost forgotten that I had done something like that while I was in Kindergarten myself.<br />
The Advent Spiral is made out of fir branches and in the middle there is a big candle.<br />
The children walk through slowly and calmly, following the spiral holding a candle placed into an apple functioning as a candle holder. In the middle they light their candle and then place the apple along the spiral on the next free spot. The whole event takes place in darkness and silence accompanied by some calm and quiet music.<br />
It was marvellous… I took some pictures afterwards and put them into the gallery for you to see yourselves!</p>
