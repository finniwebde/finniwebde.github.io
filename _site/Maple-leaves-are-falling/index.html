		<article class="content-entry"><p>Hello, it’s time again...</p>

<p>My last few weeks were pretty busy.<br />
In addition to the regular stress a couple of other things happened. Three weeks ago I went with my family on a short trip to Ucluelet, a little fishing town in the north of the island.
<!--more-->
On our way there the weather did exactly what it is supposed to do in fall! It was pouring down.<br />
But like I said that is nothing unusual here on the west coast.
After the rain had faded out I went to explore the surrounding. The fishy, salty air made the image of the little fishing harbour perfect.<br />
The “busy” part of the town is the main road with a couple of stores. Eventually it started raining again and I rescued myself into a little cafe. After an expensive piece of brownie cake I performed some magic tricks.<br />
Later that day I tried to get a great view of the sunset… of course it was super foggy and cloudy, due to the bad weather and I didn’t even get a glimpse of any sun at all. It was still very beautiful.<br />
During the short trip I fell in love with the little town, it’s people and it’s two radio channels…<br />
The next morning we walked the trail called “the wild pacific trail” to the Lighthouse of the peninsular before we had to head back home. (I have placed some photos into the <a href="/gallery">gallery</a>)</p>

<p>One of the probably biggest events was of course Halloween! How could it have been any different. It still surprised me to see the effort many people prepared themselves to the night.<br />
At home I never payed Halloween much attention. Here I saw it lined up with Easter, Christmas and the birthday. Everyone goes crazy and houses are converted into “haunted houses”. It was so exciting that I forgot to take any pictures.<br />
Good for us we got a week of holidays on the week before halloween so I could celebrate Halloween on the mainland in Vancouver.</p>

<p>The first days of the holidays I spent recovering from the school and a light flu. I couldn’t believe it but the little break did a lot of change. The last week went great and I felt a lot more RELAXED and more self-confident in working with the students. It feels like I really learned some practical things in the last two month. At least I don’t feel totally overwhelmed when I’m teaching anymore. Now “solved” that I have to tackle the greater challenge: “how to teach a bunch of kids a foreign language!?” But I think that I’m on a good way there too.</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to the “Englishman River Falls”. I asked myself if there are any comparable waterfalls in Germany. But surely they are not as beautiful. If you are looking at the photos you need to imagine a deafening rushing. Other than that there is not much to say… Oh one thing did come to my mind! “Breathtaking nature 15 minutes from home”.</p>

<p>Now I am sitting here with Zeus the always hungry cat and… whop! Now he jumped off and walks up to his food dish to check if it really is empty!</p>

<p>I’m enjoying the next week with a lot of sunshine!!!! A week without rain! That is rare here in fall, winter or spring!
But enough about weather, I wish you a nice November and I’m going to get back to you! At some point.</p>
