Finally the coding is done and the blog is ready for action!  
I will continue to upgrade the website by adding features you’re hopefully not missing until they are there…!

Since I’m going to visit the (lets call it) preparation camp for my social year on Tuesday it is just in time!  
<!--more-->
On this website there are some cool features I’m very proud of.  You might not realize them when visiting… thats why I’m listing them below! 
 
First of all it is a responsive site! that means you can display it correctly with any device without making the content look ridiculous! (try resizing your browser window horizontally and you’ll see!)
 
Secondly finniweb is bilingual which is great (check out the german version at [www.finniweb.de](http://www.finniweb.de))  

And third: the search function may not be as precise or user oriented as google but it gets the job done (one of the features you weren’t supposed to miss until there…) but the cool part of it is the search bar itself and it’s behaviour (you should definitely check it out! just click it!)

You may or may not experience some minor mistakes on this website! I hope I found and fixed them all but there is always something to do… (especially Firefox gave me a hard time)!  
I’ve run and tested this site with the Browsers Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera as well as the mobile iOS versions of Safari! If you happen to use Internet Explorer (especially versions before IE9)  you probably will encounter a lot of problems and graphically wrong aligned content since I didn’t test my site with it (due to it’s versions only run on windows). In that case you might want to upgrade to a different browser anyway!!

So if you encounter any problems or have any suggestions please let me me know about by [mailing me at support@finniweb.com](support@finniweb.com)

I hope you enjoy my site,

finni
