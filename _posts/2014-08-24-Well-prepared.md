During the last two weeks I were at the preparation seminar for my “Volutary Year Abroad”! The seminar definitely overcame my expectations!

Starting with a group of more than 50 participants we were separated into two smaller groups though we still did many activities as the big group. Under those 50 participants I only met great people. Despite the difficulties of getting to know over 50 people in just 9 days I became friends with most! In addition to the great Activities there were some discourses and workshops which taught me lots of new stuff and depend other knowledge of mine. Trough feedback exercises in which we were practicing criticising and to handle critic from others I also became more self-confident. Though I can say that I didn’t have much anxieties regarding my voluntary year I came back more self-assured like I got rid of anxieties I wasn’t even aware of.
Like most of us I would have wished to depart from there right away but my last few days in Hamburg are pretty much full anyway....
