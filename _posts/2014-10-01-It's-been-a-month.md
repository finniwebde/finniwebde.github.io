It has been a while, a month to be exact! Let me explain what took me so long!  
After I arrived I lived with Mickey and Eli and had a great time though it was a little difficult for me in the beginning of getting used to my new surrounding and meanwhile teaching young and old kids how to speak german! But at some point things felt great and I was really confident and happy! I had just cleaned my room and arranged everything and started feeling home when the fleas started to attack me. Our first move was too buy some poison and spray it in my room to get rid of the fleas! It didn’t work and after a couple of days the “happy hopping” was back!<!--more-->

After another try I gave up trying to exterminate the fleas and was looking for another room without carpet. Unfortunately there was none available! Since I couldn’t live with the fleas I had to make the decision of changing my address. I hated the idea of a new host family and it took me a while to actually make the call and tell Micky about it. It was tough and we tried to bring it behind us as fast as possible so I moved in the middle of the night.  
Fortunately Mickey and I could sort things out and we still get along very well!  
I also got lucky that my new host family is as nice and that they also live in Qualicum beach.  
Of course I had to start from beginning and try to settle in a second time! That kept me very busy while my growing personal ambitions towards my lessons took their tribute.

Now that I feel more comfortable with my home situation as well as my daily routine I’m looking forward to other stuff! I want to explore the surrounding, meet some people my age and get some hobbies going!

I know this is a rather short update for the long time I didn’t write but from now on I will keep up the writing and hopefully get the gallery to work soon! In any way I will soon tell you about my schedule at the school and how things are working out for me here on Vancouver Island!
