During the last weeks we have looked over the applications for my successor at the Morning Glory School. It was very interesting for me to be on the other side of the application process.  
Together with the requirement to write a mid term report to the “Friends of Waldorf Education”, it also made me realize how quickly time has passed and how limited my remaining time in Canada is...  
Here is my midterm report for you to read:

**Midterm report by Finn Hansch**  
***February 14, 2015***

*The “Morning Glory School” is a small little private school with about 30 students. As a Waldorf oriented School with a limited budget we try to give the students the experiences of a Waldorf education.*

*As a former Waldorf student I am now working as a Waldorf teacher. I’m teaching German and Games (Sports) and help in the preschool as well as in the Kindergarden. My working hours are from 8:30am until 3:00pm.  
In the morning I help either in the Preschool or in the Kindergarden by preparing snack or supervising the kids, giving the teachers a break.  
Afterwards I alternate with teaching German and Games in the three Grades (Grades 1-2, 3-5, &amp; 6-8). From the very beginning I have been on my own while teaching. The first two months as a teacher I had to learn to keep the class under control and how to build up some authority. Nevertheless, due to my age and my special role I could keep a different relationship with the students. That helped me a lot to motivate the students and convey the fun of learning to them.  
Like other teachers will probably experience too, I still have to face the continual struggle of encouraging silence and concentration in class. But after the first half of the year I don’t feel that overwhelmed by it anymore.  
Something that I still struggle with is preparing for the german lessons. To unite the different age groups and the different language skills is not easy. On top of that there are a lot of new students who have never taken german lessons in school before. To help those students on their first steps while keeping it interesting for the others has been a constant challenge and I am sure it will stay like that for the months to come.  
These experiences have shown me how difficult it is to learn or teach a foreign language. At the same time it has woken a passion in me to learn more languages (I hope that I am also passing that enthusiasm to my students…).*

*Since we have chosen my successor for the next school year already I will also look into preparing the next years volunteer and hopefully give her a good start in the next school year (a help I have missed in my first steps of this experience).*

*As the only volunteer at the school, I have the great possibility to expand my english and to connect more with my surroundings. Despite the  cultural differences being small there are differences and I am getting to know a different world. On the other hand I can also give something special back to this culture myself.*

*I expect the second half of my voluntary service to be less demanding because I have gotten used to my occupation and it isn’t taking up all my time and energy anymore. Therefore I want to spend the time ahead of me, here in Canada, focusing more on my personal goals. For though I will still gain new experiences working at the school, I can now again approach some hobbies and projects of my own.*
