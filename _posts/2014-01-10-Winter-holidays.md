Time flies by! Fall ended, first advent, St. Nicolas came and left, Christmas was knocking on our doors! And all the following stuff!  
It was a great time but I am also looking forward to go back to school on Monday!  
I hope you all had a great time and are now freshly energized for the coming year.  
However I wanted to tell you a little about my holidays.

The last weeks before Christmas the kids became excited for Christmas! That obviously didn’t make things easier in class. So when the break finally started it felt a little overdue but also came very sudden. The time of advent just went by without any real signs of Christmas. I guess that is not exactly true because when it started getting dark earlier you could see a lot of glowing christmas decorations in the front of and on many houses! Of course there was the Christmas faire at the Morning Glory School but that was about it.

So Christmas came even more sudden and left me with my christmas feelings as unprepared as never before!  
On Christmas Eve (the 24th of December) we had a family dinner while Santa didn’t deliver until the next morning! As quick as Christmas came it was as quick it was over and forgotten.
On New Years eve I went to Duncan (approximately 100km south of Qualicum Beach) to celebrate the new year with some other volunteers my age on the Island.  
It was nice to be around people my age again. It was a little chaotic in the morning though and I couldn’t get the bus in time. So to still get home the same day I decided to Hitchhike home! That was another thing on my bucket-list anyway and here on the island it seems to be still a used form of transportation.  
Anyways, I didn’t even had to wait long until I got picked up and brought back home!  
The last few days I struggled a little with a missing structure (since I still have holidays until Monday) and now I’m trying to get everything set up for the coming term!
